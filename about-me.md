## Outreach

I am a team member of the Lyon champter of Astronomy on Tap. We organize monthly evenings of outreach, covering a wide array of topics form current works in general relativity to the latest 4MOST news. I gave one talk titled "A guide to firing cosmic shots", explaining the mechanisms of ejections of ultra-relativistic jets from black holes.

In collaboration with artist Alex Andrix (alexandrix.com), we produced both scientific and artisitc visualizations from actual simulations.
